## What?

Originally created to fix an issue in Combodo's example on how to create a class of your own (Monitor). 
It was missing some information related to Model typology. In April 2018, my fix was accepted in the official example.

This class still exists as a separate repository because it's been extended with a few new fields: 
* type (digital signage, beamer, monitor) 
* number of VGA ports
* number of HDMI ports
* number of Display Ports

Be advised: this class may be renamed to Display or Screen in the future.

## Cookbook

XML
* create your own simple class

## Special thanks
* Combodo for their initial example and welcoming experience in the iTop Community
* @hipska for the idea to add type as an attribute
